# Raw PDFs
I create each page in befunky (It's an image editor that I'm familiar with) which has the option to export as a PDF, however it is individual files. I use https://combinepdf.com to combine them into a single cohesive PDF, but it only allows 20 files at a time, so currently the workly is to do the first 0-19 pages, make that a file, then add additional pages to that, etc.
