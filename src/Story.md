# “Guards” an Adventure for Cairn 1e
Written by Axe Wizard

## About the Adventure
The Adventure takes place in the city of Eimgan, and potentially the surrounding remote villages of Clurgh and Ontstead. Players will play the role of City Guards for the city of Eimgan, and they will face various encounters and scenarios. 

This adventure has been written with the intent of using theater of the mind, so it will not include any battle maps, however Stat Blocks will be included.

Each Patrol assignment will usually have a few suggestions for harmless scenarios, and one important scenario that may resolve in a chase, arrest, investigation, or combat! Encounters will provide a few key details (usually in bullet points) that you as the Warden can use to freely describe events as you see fit.

In the event of Character Death, the player's character will be buried with honors, and they will roll another character as a fresh recruit to fill in.

## Starting Instructions
When guiding your players through Character creation you can simply follow the standard Cairn 1e rules, with the only exceptions being do not have them roll for the Clothing trait, or for Armor, Helmets, and Shields, or Weapons. 

Each player will start with the following, as it is the standard Uniform for an Eimgan City Guard:
 - Brigandine Armor (Bulky) = 1 Armor
 - Sword (1d8)
 - Manacles

Players can select or randomize everything else as normal, and even choose to spend their starting gold on additional equipment as they see fit. (For example if they wish to have a helmet, shield, or additional weapons, they can purchase those with their own funds, but it will not be issued to them)

If there is only one player, the Warden is encouraged to roll an NPC to be the player’s Partner. They will have the same issued equipment (Brigandine and Sword). The NPC can be played by the Warden, and it will follow the Player’s lead, however the Warden can use the NPC to warn the Player of danger, or suggest ideas should the Player struggle.

Finally, any text written in _italics_ are intended to be read aloud to the players

## Intro
Once the Players have rolled their characters and are satisfied with their starting equipment, we can begin!

_Our story begins with you anxiously waiting outside the office of Guard Captain Geberic. You each are standing at attention facing the stout oak door awaiting to officially report for duty as new City Guards of Eimgan. Lieutenant Vandil is giving you instructions in an uninterested tone, as though he was bored: “The Great City of Eimgan appreciates your initiative and valor for joining the City Guard. Captain Geberic will take your oaths and officially swear you in, and give you your initial briefing momentarily. You may stand at ease until that door opens.”_

_Before you can even relax your stance, the door swings open outward from the room, and in the door stands a man of medium height and athletic build. What little hair he has left is flecked with grey, and his weathered skin creases in a smile as he addresses you in a gravelly voice:_

_“Look at you standing at attention, outstanding discipline! We’re going to get along great, I can already tell. Come in, come in.” He stands aside and gestures for you to enter._

_As you enter you see a line drawn on the floor in front of his desk. You instinctively toe the line and stand once more at attention. You hear the thud of the heavy door closing behind you, and footsteps as the man walks around to his desk, eyeing you as he rests his hands on his chair facing you. He speaks:_

_“Good, good. Already kitted out and didn’t even have to be told to toe the line. Excellent. Be at ease, relax.”. He takes his seat as you relax your stance, shrugging off the stiffness of standing inert for so long._

_“I am Captain Geberic as you’re probably already aware, and today you become official protectors of the City of Eimgan. Before I take your oaths, do you have any questions of me?”_

Give the players an opportunity to speak if they wish. Geberic is a seasoned soldier who appreciates questions and will answer as best he can, however he will not take kindly to jokes or nonsense.

Once any questions have been answered, you may continue:

_“Are you ready to take the Protector’s Oath?” Geberic asks you nonchalantly, however his eyes are shrewdly observing your reactions, waiting for any hesitation. Seeing none as you all voice “Yes Captain” brings a smile to his face._

_“Excellent!” he exclaims, beaming at you as he stands proudly and begins to unravel a well-worn parchment. You instinctively snap to the position of attention._

Geberic is about to recite the oath and the players should repeat after him. Feel free to break it down into 3-5 word bursts for easier memory if needed.

_“Repeat after me” commands Geberic, in a well practiced ceremonial voice: “I pledge my Strength and Valor to safeguard the people of this City”_

If the players do not repeat the first line of the oath, Captain Geberic looks at them pointedly and repeats it again with a hard stare.

_“I shall uphold Justice, protect the weak, and maintain order”_

_“I vow to stand as a shield against threats, both within and beyond our walls”_

_“I will not waver in the face of danger, nor falter in my duty”_

_“I embrace this responsibility as a protector of the people”_

_“And I will serve with honor and integrity.”_

_“This I swear”_

_Captain Geberic allows the parchment to roll itself back up as he places it back on his desk. “Remember your oaths, and do your best. These are troubled times and you are needed more than ever. This is not a job for the weak, not many would volunteer to do what you do, hold your heads high and proud, and bring honor to this uniform.”_

_Geberic slowly exhales as he walks around to the front of his desk. “Relax, relax. Now let me brief you on your duties”. He lounges on the edge of his desk, crossing his arms, leaning in as he speaks in an unexpected soft voice:_

_“I’ll be honest, it’s a dangerous job, now more so than ever before. There’s a very real chance you may fall in the line of duty, but that is what we do. You’ll be assigned as a team, you’ll work together, and I advise you all to stick together. A lone guard is a dead guard. Look out for each other and keep everyone safe.”_

_He sighs as he straightens slightly, his voice returning back to his normal gruff gravelly tone “Shifts will be rotating periodically, for now you’ll be on duty from nightfall to dawn. Normally I’d assign you daylight hours, and place a senior guard with you to guide you until you feel more confident, but we’re already undermanned as it is.”_

_He looks at each of you and grins: “On a good note though, if you make it through your first shift unharmed, you’ll have some serious bragging rights in the barracks!” He laughs as he stands up and walks around you to the door._

_“Rest up, your first shift is tonight. You’ll be shown to your quarters and you’ll find your assignment posted on the board outside your door. Don’t be late! I’ll let you get to your preparations, and I know you’ll make me proud” He opens the door and waves you out of his office, where you are met once again by Lieutenant Vandil_

_“I’ll show you to your quarters. Expect to have your assignment posted on your assignment board before your watch begins. In the event there is no assignment posted, you are to see me directly”_

_Vandil leads you through the barracks to your assigned quarters. As you pass through the halls you can see your fellow guardsmen, attending to various tasks while they are off duty. Some are caring for their arms and armor, some are dressing wounds, some are fast asleep, and others are playing various games involving dice or cards. Some of them glance up and meet your gaze as you pass. Some smile, some nod, some ignore you and go back to what they’re doing._

_One thing you notice from all of them though, is that they are all tired and sporting various scars. You wonder just what exactly you signed up for, but your thoughts are interrupted as Vandil halts before a rough wooden door with a small posting board to the left of the doorway._

_“Here are your quarters. As the Captain already advised you, you are a single unit, a team. Inside you’ll find your cots with clean linens ready for use. You are expected to maintain your quarters, just as you will your arms and armor. Should you have any questions, see Barracks Sergeant Gelimer. I’d advise getting some rest before your first assignment!” And with that, he brusquely walks back the way he came, leaving you to your quarters._

With the intro concluded, the players have the entire day to themselves before their first watch tonight. They may use this time to get to know one another if they wish to roleplay, or may simply wish to rest and start their first watch. 

Note that even though they were advised to rest, players should not be Fatigued or Deprived for their first watch even if they chose not to rest.

## 1: Market District
 - Players will be patrolling around the Markets during the night. 
 - All the shops should be closed, and there should be almost nobody on the streets at this time. 
 - Keep in mind eyesight will be poor, and at least one player should be holding a torch if they are to see anything at all.

_As you are readying yourselves for the coming patrol, you hear the sound of a hammer driving a nail into the Assignment Board outside your quarters. You crowd around your assignment board reading the few short words scribbled on a parchment: “Market District”. It’s not much to go off of, but you know what you’re supposed to do. Oaths fresh in your minds you set out together to the Market District to start your patrol._

Players will most likely be on alert, so be sure to inform them of any sounds they might hear. The players should encounter some harmless scenarios during the patrol, such as:
 - A stray animal
 - A tired shopkeeper leaving late
 - Street kids out and about after Curfew
 - Signs of Vandalism

One of the things they should investigate before the night is over, is a burglary in progress! 
 - Players can be alerted by a sound, or furtive movement. 
 - As they investigate, the burglar will try to hide or flee. 
 - If confronted the burglar will try to lie. 
 - If all else fails, the burglar will fight just enough to try to break free and run. 
 - If the players catch and restrain the burglar, he will give up and allow himself to be arrested.

#### Burglar
Name: "Dags" (if he lies, he'll say his name is Henson Halmoor, a prominent merchant)  
HP: 4  Armor: 0  
STR: 9   DEX: 14   WIL: 10
 - Dagger (1d6)
 - Rope (25ft)
 - Lockpicks
 - Crowbar
 - Coin purse containing 4d6 Gold
 - Stolen Merchandise (bulky)
 - Cryptic Letter (the words make no sense, some type of code, unreadable)

### Market District: Conclusion
Once the shift is ending, the players will head back to the Barracks and see the Duty Officer to report anything of note they encountered while on patrol.

_With the sun now beginning to rise, signaling the end of your first patrol, you make your way back to the Barracks to report to the Officer on Duty. You walk into the Duty Office to find a uniformed man dozing off in a chair, seated behind a desk. The man’s eyes pop open as your footsteps echo off the walls. He straightens in his chair and reaches for quill and parchment._

_“Must be dawn already, let’s see… you were the Market District patrol, yes? Anything to report?”_

Here the players can give their report. 
 - If they arrested the Burglar, the Duty Officer will have two other stationed guards take the burglar away.  
 - If the Cryptic Letter is given to the Duty Officer, he will accept it with a shrug, and place it somewhere on his desk.

Once everything has been discussed, the Duty Officer will pay each player 5 gold, and advise the players to get some rest, and visit the Infirmary should they require healing.

### Downtime
Now the players have some time to themselves before their next patrol. Common activities players may wish to do in their downtime:
 - Visit the markets and buy weapons, armor, supplies, and items
 - Visit the Infirmary to heal any wounds (Normally healing wounds would take several days or weeks depending on the severity, but for the purposes of this adventure the Infirmary can treat any wounds within a matter of hours through rare magical means)
 - Roleplay with one another, including pursuing any personal backstories or other errands/tasks the players may have.
 - Rest up and proceed immediately to the next assignment.

## 2: Residential District
 - Players will be patrolling around the Residential district during the night. 
 - The streets should be empty and most lights should be out in the various windows of the neighborhood, but there still may be some people about. 
 - Keep in mind eyesight will be poor, and at least one player should be holding a torch if they are to see anything at all.

_As you are readying yourselves for your second patrol, you hear the sound of a hammer driving a nail into the Assignment Board outside your quarters. You crowd around your assignment board reading the few short words scribbled on a parchment: “Residential District''. Looks like another standard evening patrol. At least you’re not as nervous this time as you have a better idea of what to expect. You set out together to the Residential District to start your patrol._

Players will most likely be on alert, so be sure to inform them of any sounds they might hear. Have them investigate a few things that turn out to be harmless, here are some ideas you can throw at them:
 - A drunkard shambling home
 - Someone emptying a chamber pot out a window
 - A tired baker leaving their house for work before dawn
 - Two neighbors arguing over a barking dog

One of the things they should investigate before the night is over, is a domestic disturbance. The players will hear a man shouting, and a woman screaming. As the players go to investigate the source of the noise, read the following aloud:

_As you approach the source of the disturbance, you see shadowed movement ahead of you, and you hear a man’s voice screaming “Help me please, he’s going to kill me!” followed by rapid footsteps coming your way._

From here, let the players try to figure out what the hell is happening. 
 - This first man (named Thidrek) is completely naked, clutching a bundle of clothes and looking terrified. 
 - He is pursued by an angry man (named Candac)
 - A hysterical woman (named Aleyda) is trying to restrain Candac. 

Candac came home late and found Thidrek in bed with his wife Aleyda, and thus was chasing Thidrek in a blind rage.

Including stat blocks for all because wow, this scenario can get crazy! Here are some things to note:
 - Thidrek wants to stay as far away from Candac as possible, and will take off running the first chance he gets. 
 - Candac will become enraged and attack if the players side with Thidrek, and may potentially strike Aleyda if Thidrek is arrested or killed. 
 - Aleyda is hysterical and begging Candac to calm down, and she will scream and attack the players if anything bad happens to Candac (even if Candac strikes her).

#### Thidrek
HP: 2   Armor: 0  
STR: 9    DEX: 12    WIL: 15
 - Unarmed (1d4)
 - Bundle of Clothes

#### Candac
HP: 5   Armor: 0  
STR: 12   DEX: 9   WIL: 12
 - Cudgel (1d6)
 - Empty Wineskin
 - Coin purse containing 2d6 Gold

#### Aleyda
HP: 2   Armor: 0  
STR: 8   DEX: 11   WIL: 10
 - Unarmed (1d4)
 - Linen Bed Sheet

### Residential District: Conclusion
As it was with the first Patrol, the players will make their way back to the Barracks to the Duty Office and make their report. Once the report is complete, each player will receive 5 gold and then will be on Downtime until their next Assignment.

If any arrests were made, the Duty Officer will take custody and handle the process from there

## 3: Dockside District
 - Players will be patrolling around the Dockside district during the night. 
 - The streets are actually fairly lively late into the evening. 
 - The populace will consist mostly of sailors and deckhands who grow rowdier as the evening goes on. 
 - Keep in mind eyesight will be poor, and at least one player should be holding a torch if they are to see anything at all.

_The familiar sound of a hammer striking a nail into your Assignment Board interrupts your thoughts as you all shuffle out of your room to look at your next assignment: “Dockside District”. You gather your equipment and head out, feeling more confident now that you’ve got a few patrols under your belt, but you can’t help but feel nervous, as you know the Dockside District is one of the rowdiest and most dangerous areas of the city._

Players will be on alert, however there are going to be many sights and sounds happening from rowdy sailors, tavern wenches, and belligerent deckhands. 
 - The player characters would have knowledge that Tavern Brawls are a common occurrence that isn’t illegal, but murder or destruction of property certainly is.

Ease the players in with a few harmless things, here are some ideas:
 - Some patrons of a tavern having a fistfight while a crowd cheers (fistfights aren't illegal)
 - Drunken sailors stumbling around
 - Angry conversation about how those in power mistreat the lower class, and people have about had enough
 - Someone passed out in the street snoring loudly
 - Perhaps the players see something floating in the water, such as an empty crate

One of the things they should investigate before the night is over is a particularly violent fight in a tavern. The players will hear the sound of angry shouting, breaking glass, wood splintering, and the ring of steel. When they arrive on the scene you can read the following aloud:

_As you arrive at the scene of chaos, you quickly survey the surroundings and take in the situation. The first thing you notice immediately is two men hacking at each other with cutlasses, and one man is bleeding from a wound on his arm, staining his shirt with a growing blotch of crimson. The gathered crowd has given the combatants a wide berth, and the Tavern Keeper is shouting for them to stop as one combatant throws a wooden stool at the other. The Tavern Keeper sees you and implores you to intercede._

The players should try to break up the fight to prevent any more bloodshed or property damage, but may have to defend themselves depending on how the scenario develops. 
 - Neither combatant will drop their weapon while the other still holds theirs. 
 - They won’t attack a Player unless a Player attacks them. 
 - If a Player attacks one of the combatants with a weapon (attempts to grapple or restrain are fine), other people in the crowd may get involved. 
 - Should the crowd get involved they are considered a Detachment, and if a player takes critical damage, the Tavern Keeper will step in and persuade the Crowd to disperse (reasoning that if they kill any guards they’ll all be hanged when word gets out). 
 - If the crowd gets involved, the combatants will both flee.

#### Narin (Combatant #1)
HP: 6   Armor: 0  
STR: 11   DEX: 12   WIL 9
 - Cutlass (1d8)
 - Pulley
 - Empty coin purse

#### Rodolf (Combatant #2, Wounded)
HP: 0/6   Armor: 0  
STR: 7/9   DEX: 11   WIL: 13
 - Cutlass (1d8)
 - Loaded Dice Set
 - Coin purse containing 3d20 Gold

#### Crowd (Detachment, refer to Cairn ruleset)
HP: 4
STR: 7   DEX: 9   WIL 13
 - Unarmed (1d4, 1d12 blast if enhanced)
 - Crowd will disperse and run if they take critical damage

### Dockside District: Conclusion
As it was with the previous Patrols, the players will make their way back to the Barracks to the Duty Office and make their report. Once the report is complete, each player will receive 5 gold and then will be on Downtime until their next Assignment.

## 4: Missing Tax Collector
 - Players will be given additional downtime to prepare for their next assignment. 
 - Investigate the missing whereabouts of  a Tax Collector who was tasked to to collect taxes from the villages of Clurgh and Ontstead. 
 - This mission will take several in-game days to complete.

_As you are all doing final checks on your gear waiting for your assignment to be posted, you’re all startled by your door opening. As your heads snap in the door’s direction you find Lieutenant Vandil looking through a sheaf of parchment._

_“Consider this a rare opportunity to excel. I was going to assign you to patrol the Slums District tonight, but something of greater priority has arisen. You will rest until the morning, where you will meet a gentleman by the name of Marcomir Frithilla at the Tax and Excise office.”_

_“Marcomir will brief you on the particulars, but from what I understand, some Tax Collector has gone missing, and naturally they wish to find out what happened to him…”  He shrewdly looks at each of you. “Hmm, or perhaps they’re more concerned about the taxes he potentially collected?”_

_He chuckles and shakes his head. “Well you have your orders. You have until the morning to rest more, if you wish. After you’ve spoken to Marcomir, be sure to see Quartermaster Berig here in the Barracks, he shall see you’re outfitted with supplies before you set off.”_

Now the players have some downtime, however since it is evening now, shops and marketplaces will be closed, however a Tavern or two will certainly be open should they wish to indulge.

When they finally go to meet Marcomir, you can read this aloud:

_You proceed to the Tax and Excise office as ordered. Upon entering you’re greeted by a dingy interior, smelling of dust and old parchment. You see a balding clerk at a table looking up at you from his work. He speaks in a faltering tone:_

_“Oh you must be the Investigators, come right this way, I’ll show you to Marcomir’s office.” He swings his feet around and grabs a nearby cane, and starts limping slowly toward an unexpectedly lavish door of a beautiful dark stained wood, with a glossy varnish. Upon reaching it he opens the door and pokes his head in, only to be greeted with a loud irritated voice: “What is it now?”_

_“Apologies for the interruption, but the Investigators you requested have arrived.”_

_“Excellent, show them in at once.” the voice says._

_The Clerk opens the door wider and stands to one side to allow you to pass into the office of Marcomir. Your vision is immediately assaulted by the gaudy opulence of not only Marcomir, but everything within the office. The desk he sits behind is another beautiful dark stained wood, yet this has golden inlays with artistic shapes and accents. Several display cases line the wall either side of the doorway, and a bookshelf packed with books along the back wall. From above, light floods in through ornate stained glass windows casting a myriad of colors across everything._

_Marcomir himself is dressed in a black and gold robe with a feathered beret that is also black and gold. He stands from his chair which is the size of a small throne and throws his arms wide: “Excellent, I knew Geberic wouldn’t let me down, we do pay your wages after all” he smirks looking at each of you. “I know, extravagant isn’t it? Well pick your jaws up off the floor, we’ve business to discuss!” You hear the sound of the clerk closing the door behind you. “Normally I’d invite you to sit but…” he looks at your armor “I’d rather you not damage my priceless furniture. I’ll make it brief”._

_He brings his hands together in a steeple in front of him as he pauses dramatically. “One of my subordinate collectors, a man named Bragen, is missing. Understand me clearly: I care nothing for this man. What I do care about however, is the taxes that were collected. I’ve reason to believe Bragen absconded with the gold. I want it back.”_

_“In addition to your regular daily wages you’ll earn, I’ll pay you each 30 gold for the return of collected taxes, with proof that it was the full amount that was collected, otherwise you’d probably just skim a bit off the top for yourselves. We keep ledgers, so Bragen most likely has one. I’ll throw in another 20 for gold for each of you if you also discover proof that Bragen did indeed commit this theft and you bring him before me so he may stand trial and be sentenced.”_

_“Have you any questions?” He asks, looking at each of you._

At this point the players can ask any questions if they need clarification. 
 - Marcomir will grow more irritated and condescending with each question. 
 - All he wants is the money returned with proof, and Bragen to be brought before him if possible.
 - He recommends the Players go to Clurgh first.

Once the players are done speaking with Marcomir, they’ll obtain supplies from the Barracks. Each player will receive
 - 3 days Rations (1 slot)
 - Small field tent (1 slot) (Houses only 1 player, personal tent)
 - The group as a whole will receive a Mule (6 slots, slow) that is intended to be used to haul any recovered taxes back to the city.

Once equipped, the players will set out a few hours before noon. It is a half day’s journey to either Clurgh or Ontstead, and about the same between the two villages.

### Clurgh
During the course of the Player’s investigation of Clurgh, they will find that the populace is wary of the Players, and won’t divulge any information regarding Bragen freely. The players can try to persuade, coerce, or bribe people for information. Key individuals that have useful information are:
 - Hralgor, the Tavern Keeper (Bragen flaunts his wealth and demeans tavern patrons)
 - Mortimer, the Village Elder (Bragen is dishonest, and takes advantage of simple folk)
 - Gertrude, a random villager (Bragen was last seen departing for Ontstead)

What the players should eventually learn is that Bragen was taking advantage of illiterate villagers and taking more than he should have been, and pocketing the extra. Bragen was last seen setting out for Ontstead.

### Ontstead
During the course of the Player’s investigation of Ontstead, they will find that the populace is wary of the Players' presence, and won’t talk freely without being persuaded to. Key individuals that have useful information are:
 - Conrad, the Tavern Keeper (Bragen was seen, but didn’t stop in for his usual ale before departing)
 - Cecilia, a Tanner (Bragen had already collected taxes from her)
 - Samuel, a Blacksmith (Bragen hasn’t collected taxes from him yet)

Once the players have all the pieces, they’ll overhear someone talking about a man named Ardveg, who is a hunter, was able to afford an expensive cure for his wife’s ailment.

_“Did you hear that Ardveg was finally able to afford the cure for his dear Helva? She’s still a bit weak but she definitely seems to be on the mend. I wonder though… Where did he get the money? Oh well I suppose it's none of my business, just glad Helva’s going to be okay”_

If the players follow this thread, they’ll discover Ardveg had had enough of Bragen trying to extort him with his wife dying, and murdered Bragen.
 - If players confront Ardveg, he’ll confess everything and beg for the players to leave him be, as he only did it to stop Bragen from terrorizing others and to save his dying wife.
 - Ardveg will offer to take the Players to where he disposed of Bragen. 
 - If the players decide to arrest Ardveg, he’ll fly into a rage and fight to the death.
 - If Ardveg dies before he shows the Players where he hid Bragen, they won’t find anything and will return empty-handed.

#### Ardveg
HP: 6   Armor: 1  
STR: 12   DEX: 14   WIL: 12
 - Hunting Bow (1d8 when wielded by Ardveg, else only 1d6)
 - Skinning Knife (1d6)
 - Handaxe (1d8) (If melee, Ardveg will dual wield Handaxe and Knife)
 - Empty coin purse
 - Smelly Hide Armor (1 Armor)

If the players find the corpse of Bragen, they’ll find the following:
 - Heavy Lockbox (extremely bulky, takes up 4 slots, contains 2,195 gold (50 gold missing))
 - Tax Ledger (states that collected amount should total 2,245 gold)
 - Journal (states that Bragen pocketed 237 extra gold that is not on the ledgers)
 - Heavy Satchel (contains 237 gold)

Players shouldn’t be penalized if they decide to keep the extra gold Bragen stole. Marcomir is only concerned with what’s on the ledger.

### Missing Tax Collector: Conclusion
Because there’s so many ways the players could decide to handle this, I’ll cover some bases:

If the players decide to take the money and run:
 - The written adventure ends here, you’re on your own!
 - Wanted posters will be circulated throughout the region
 - Bounty Hunters will be hired to track them down.
 - Enjoy the chaos!

If the players decide to return to Eimgan:
 - The players should journey back to Eimgan and report to Marcomir (preferably with the Heavy Lockbox and the Ledger).
 - If the amount returned matches the amount listed in the ledger, Marcomir will pay each player 30 gold.
 - If the players brought back the corpse of Bragen, Marcomir will be disgusted, and demand proof of Bragen’s misconduct. If no proof is provided, no bonus gold is received.
 - Should the Players try to forge false proof of Bragen's attempt to run off with the gold, Marcomir will still accept it and pay the Players the promised bonus, as he hates the man.
 - Should the amount specified in the Ledger and the amount returned not match, Marcomir will inform Geberic, and Geberic will have other guards search the Players.
 - If Marcomir has Geberic search the players, and they find an excess of missing funds they pocketed, they will be arrested and jailed. If jailed, the written adventure is over, but you're still free to keep playing! Jailbreaks, on the run as criminals, could be fun!

Once business with Marcomir is concluded, the players should return to the Duty Office in the Barracks and receive daily wages for every day they were gone. (Should be about 2 day’s worth at least) From there Lieutenant Vandil will speak with them:

_“Good you’re back. Thank you for completing that investigation. I’ve authorized each of you to take a day off for recuperation, and then it will be back to standard night watch for you all. I’ll post your patrol assignment on your board.”_

Players are now on Downtime to do as they wish.

## 5: Slums District
 - Players will be patrolling around the Slums during the night. 
 - There will be ramshackle shelters strewn throughout the streets. 
 - Crime is most prominent here and Guards are not well-liked. 
 - Keep in mind eyesight will be poor, and at least one player should be holding a torch if they are to see anything at all.

_You crowd around your assignment board reading the few short words scribbled on a parchment: “Slums District”. You all look to one another, feeling disappointment after such a lowly assignment after the excitement of your previous investigation assignment. After checking your gear, you all head out to the stench of the Slums District to do your patrol._

Players will be on alert, and the Slums will be fairly active in the evening hours. As the evening progresses to early morning there will be less and less people about. 

As always give the players a few harmless scenarios such as:
 - Two men having a loud verbal argument
 - A homeless vagrant sleeping in the middle of the street
 - Beggars asking the players to take pity on them and spare them a coin
 - Desparate souls crowding around a cart of someone freely giving food to the people

One of the things they should encounter before the night is over is a cutpurse swipes the coin purse of one of the players! Select a player to be the target (how you decide this is up to you) and then read the following:

_As you turn a corner on your patrol, <player name>, you feel a slight rustle at your hip. You quickly turn and look to find a dirty man with a small dagger clutching your coin purse he just cut from you. He's already turning to run._

At this point have the player make a DEX save to see if they can grab the cutpurse’s arm before they can flee out of range.
 - If the cutpurse is restrained by a player, they cannot flee unless they succeed at a DEX save. 
 - If multiple players are restraining them, they will need to succeed at a STR save. 
 - If players use an item or have some way to restrain the cutpurse other than their strength (Rope, Manacles, Chain, Twine, etc), the cutpurse will give up and go quietly.
 - Should the cutpurse escape and the players give chase, the cutpurse should run into an armed man, who is demanding the cutpurse give him his money back. 
 - If the players managed to apprehend the cutpurse before he can flee, the armed man will walk up to them and demand they hand over the cutpurse to him.
 - The armed man will try to take the target player’s coin purse that the thief stole, and will attack the players if they intervene.

#### Nelman (Cutpurse)
HP: 2   Armor: 0  
STR: 8   DEX: 12   WIL: 9
 - Dagger (1d6)
 - Player’s coin purse (If not yet retrieved)
 - Dark clothing

### Slums District: Conclusion
Players will make their way back to the Barracks to the Duty Office and make their report. Once the report is complete, each player will receive 5 gold. However, Lieutenant Vandil will intercept them and task them with an immediate assignment!

## 6: Main Gate
 - This assignment immediately follows the previous one, and as such Players will be considered Deprived.
 - It will be during the day, so visibility will be unimpaired.
 - Players will be monitoring who enters and exits the city.

_As you all head back to your quarters in the Barracks, Lieutenant Vandil hurriedly intercepts you._

_“I hate to spring this on you all, I know you just finished the night watch, but I need you to relieve the  guards at the Main Gate immediately. They’ll brief you on your duties when you arrive. I’ll try to find a replacement for you but expect to be on duty the entire day. I’ll make sure you all get a small bonus when you report to the Duty Office when you’re relieved.”_

_Before you can reply or ask questions, Lieutenant Vandil moves along rummaging through sheaves of parchment and muttering curses underneath his breath. You all look to one another, exhausted from patrolling the Slums all night, and dejectedly set off to the Main Gate_

_As you arrive you see three of your fellow guards perk up at your arrival. One of them, a raven-haired woman greets you: “You here to relieve us? Our relief never showed up and we’ve been here all night.” Seeing you all nod a huge smile creases through her battered face. “About time, my feet are killing me.”_

_She looks at each of you “I haven’t seen you all posted here before, so let me brief you on what to do: It’s simple, check everyone who is trying to enter the city. Any mules, horses, wagons, packs, and crates are to be searched for contraband. If you get a bad feeling about anyone, you can deny them entry. If anyone makes a big fuss or says they’re important and threatens to get you fired or something silly like that, one of you should wake up old Lieutenant Connor who lives upstairs in the Gatehouse. That old bloke knows everyone who is anyone in this city and can quickly sort out that nonsense. Any questions?”_

Here the players can ask any questions, but really there isn’t any more to be said:
 - Check anyone entering the city, if players feel they have ill intent or don’t belong, they can turn them away.
 - Search any containers for contraband (what qualifies as "contraband" is up to you, but usually things like large caches of weapons, illegal substances, etc).
 - Wake up Lieutenant Connor in the Gatehouse if someone demands to speak to your superiors

_The weary guard motions to her comrades “Alright we’re off to finally get some rest, good luck out there!”, and they all trudge off in the direction of the barracks. You’re officially on duty at the Main Gate!_

Here the players are standing guard at the Main Gate:
 - It is daytime, no torches or light sources are needed.

Give the players a few innocent scenarios such as:
 - Legitimate trader with a donkey laden with trade goods.
 - Group of farmers from Clurgh coming to get supplies.
 - A Newcomer to the city asking the players for directions or where to find goods and services.
 - Pompous man who refuses to be searched and demands to "speak with the supervisor"
 - Official Courier galloping towards the gate

During their shift, they’ll encounter a “merchant” with a wagon full of goods pulled by two horses.
 - If the players try to search the cart, the man will attempt to bribe the players with 25 gold total to let him pass (He’ll haggle all the way to a total of 100 gold).
 - If the players refuse the bribe (or change their mind after receiving the bribe), the man will be visibly angry but stand aside and allow the search.
 - There is nothing wrong with the cargo inside the wagon (It’s all foodstuffs), however underneath the wagon, there is some crates in a hidden storage area that contain an alarming amount of weapons (swords and crossbows) padded with clothing and bedding to keep it quiet.
 - If the players find the concealed weapons, the man will attack!
 - If the man attacks, he will fight to the death.
 - If a player goes down, Relief Guards will show up and intervene

#### Merciless Merchant
HP: 6   Armor: 2   
STR: 14   DEX: 13   WIL: 10
 - Chainmail Armor (Concealed beneath light robe): 2 Armor
 - Poison Dagger (1d6 damage, Critical Damage: Poisons target). If poisoned, the target must make a WIL save each turn until they succeed (even if unconscious). Upon failure, they take 1 additional damage that ignores Armor.
 - Throwing Daggers x3 (1d6, ranged)
 - Coin Purse containing 100 gold (minus any amount of any bribe given)
 - Cryptic Letter (the words make no sense, some type of code, unreadable)

#### Relief Guards (3 total)
HP: 4   Armor: 1  
STR: 12   DEX: 10   WIL: 10
 - Sword (1d8)
 - Bow (1d6)

### Main Gate: Conclusion
Once the scenario with the Merciless Merchant has concluded (whether or not the players searched the cart): 
 - Guards sent to relieve you will arrive. (Unless arrival was already triggered earlier by a player going unconscious)

If players allowed the merchant through:
 - Nothing special happens (right now), they can return to the Barracks

If players fought the Merciless Merchant:
 - Lieutenant Connor is awoken by the commotion and advises players to take the merchant (dead or alive) to the Duty Office, along with the cart and its contents.

Regardless of how it turned out:
 - Upon returning to the Barracks and reporting to Duty Officer, players will each receive a total of 10 gold each, 5 for normal duty, and 5 for a bonus from Lieutenant Vandil.
 - If the Cryptic Letter is given to the Duty Officer, he will add it to a growing pile of similar letters. If the players ask about the letters, he'll say it's being investigated.
 - Players are now on Downtime until the next morning.

## 7: Search and Seizure
 - In this scenario Players will be aiding an investigation into the Cryptic Letters
 - Players will be escorting an investigator who will lead them in a smash and grab operation on a shady safehouse
 - The occupants of the safehouse will panic at their arrival, and start destroying evidence
 - This is a dangerous mission, for this scenario if a player takes Critical Damage, they won't be able to fight but they can hobble with assistance from another player or NPC

_You're all up and ready to go at dawn, feeling refreshed after yesterday's ordeals of double duty. You're all busying yourselves preparing for whatever the day brings, expectantly waiting for the tell-tale sound of a new assignment being posted. You all look up as the door opens to see a tired-looking Lieutenant Vandil in the doorway:_

_"Oh good, you're all up and ready to go", he steps into the room and another figure enters behind him. Vandil continues: "I have an interesting duty that I was asked to assign to a reliable unit, and I've assured Ervig here that you're it.". He steps aside and Ervig steps forward looking at all of you. Ervig is a slender man, sharp features with a waxed curled mustache and piercing eyes. He wears the standard uniform, but he has an additional breastplate, and a stylish feathered cap. He speaks in a crisp concise tone:_

_"Morning! I'll get right to it. Lieutenant Vandil was gracious enough to volunteer you all to aid me in an investigation. You may have noticed these Cryptic Letters that have been cropping up lately? Well I've not yet found a cipher key or a way to translate the code, but I have discovered a location where these letters seem to originate from. I've been keeping an eye on it in order to try to establish security patterns. From what I've been able to tell, they're fairly lax. Unfortunately there's no way to sneak in unnoticed, so the only option left is to raid the place by force, and I need backup."_

_Leiutenant Vandil chimes in: "This location appears to be a shady safehouse in the Slums District. Normally we would have never been able to keep an eye on the place, as you may have noticed we're not well liked in the Slums, but we've been able to perform discreet surveillance from a high hidden vantage point in one of the taller buildings in the Market District. What this means is that you'll be seen approaching well before you arrive on site, so you'll need to strike fast."_

_Ervig continues: "I expect to meet resistance, but keep in mind we're there to find evidence, evidence that they will most likely try to hide or dispose of once they hear of our arrival. Right now is the best time to strike, early in the morning while most of them are still groggy from drinking. We'll need to be as fast as possible to get in, and carry as much as we can on our way out, so travel light. Any questions?"_

The players can ask any clarifying questions, but really this mission is straight forward, it's a smash and grab:
 - Once they set out they'll be following Ervig, and they'll all be running at a fast pace. They may end up getting a point or 2 of fatigue through the course of this mission.
 - The goal is to seize as much evidence as possible (and prevent destruction of evidence)
 - They must keep up with and protect Ervig

_Ervig nods and says: "Good, get your equipment sorted out and meet me outside.", he quickly exits the room leaving Lieutenant Vandil who says: "Sounds like you all better hurry, I'll get out of your way. Stick with Ervig, he'll see you through, and hopefully we can finally find out what all these letters mean." and with that Vandil exits as well._

Once they players are ready, they'll meet Ervig outside the Barracks:

_You exit the Barracks to find Ervig waiting for you. "There's a tavern close to the Slums that we'll head to. It's not unusual to see Guards there, so we shouldn't draw much notice. From there we'll need to move as fast as we can, to give any lookouts as little time as possible to react. Let's move" and he turns and starts quickly walking with a purpose. You all hurry to follow._

_You arrive at the tavern to of course find it closed as it is morning. Ervig mutters under his breath to you: "Act like we're inspecting the tavern for signs of vandalism, and meet me around the back. Whatever you do, don't look in the direction of the Slums or draw attention.", and with that he starts a slow circle around the tavern, making a show of looking for damage. You start to do the same, circling the opposite direction_

If players ignore Ervig's advice and look in the direction of the Slums, they'll notice someone watching them, who will take off running when they make eye contact. Once they players have made their circle around the back of the tavern, they'll meet Ervig in the back

_You arrive at the back of the Tavern to find Ervig waiting for you: "Alright, this is it. We sprint from here. Weapons out. Remember our objective, and don't get distracted. Ready?"_

Once the players are ready, it's go time. This will be a mad dash to keep up with Ervig until everyone reaches the safehouse. 
 - This will be achieved with 3 rounds of DEX saves
 - On a failed DEX save, the player takes 1 Fatigue

_Ervig takes a deep breath, draws his sword. You all do the same. "With me!" he barks and as one you all take off in a full sprint. Immediately cries of alarm can be heard as you rush headfirst into the Slums. "They're coming! They're coming!" someone is shouting nearby. Beggars and vagrants who were sitting in the street mere moments ago are now running in all directions._

Have each player make a DEX save, any who fail take 1 point of Fatigue

_With thundering strides and blood pumping, you continue running. Ervig struggles to shout: "Keep moving!" as you all continue running as fast as you can._

Have each player make another DEX save, any who fail take 1 point of Fatigue

_Amidst the chaos of the random people running in panic at your sudden charge, you see two figures up ahead that are not running away from you, but toward you. As you draw near you can clearly see the looks of panic and desperation. Ervig charges right into them and knocks both of them over with a momentous thud. "Keep moving!" he shouts, as he scrabbles to his feet and continues his indomitable advance. "Almost there!" Ahead you see more figures crowding at the entrance of an especially ratty looking structure. You keep running with everything you have, but you're starting to slow._

Have each player make one final DEX save, any who fail take 1 point of Fatigue

_Ervig tries to shout, but can only manage an audible wheeze: "This is the place!". Just ahead are two men holding weapons, nervously blocking the entrance to this rundown shack. From behind them you hear a panicked voice: "They're already here! HURRY!", followed by a door slamming shut. You suspect they're trying to hide or destroy evidence, but you'll have to get through the two armed men first._

Here is a standard combat encounter:  

#### Ervig
HP: 6   Armor: 2  
STR: 15   DEX: 12   WIL: 18
 - Sword (1d8)
 - Brigandine with Breastplate (2 armor, bulky)

#### Thugs (x2)
HP: 5   Armor: 0  
STR: 12   DEX: 10   WIL: 9
 - Cudgel (1d6)

After the thugs have been dealt with, the players will need to breach the door. They can do this with a simple STR save, or simply hacking it apart with their weapons. After they've breached the door, we continue:

_You breach the weak door and push your way inside to find a few tables covered in scattered parchment and two panicked men hurriedly throwing everything they can into a freshly lit fire. Ervig manages to bark out "Eimgan City Guard! Put your hands up!" which causes both of them to drop what they were carrying any put their arms up, eyes wide in terror. Ervig turns to you and sharply says: "We don't have much time, search and seize everything you can!"_

Within this shack, there's several items that could be important. The two panicked men can also be coerced into revealing hidden items. They will also make a run for it if there's a chance! Keep in mind Ervig can hold up to 6 inventory slots of items if the players are burdened.

Items in plain sight:
 - More Cryptic Letters on the Tables (1 slot)
 - Stash of weapons (can't carry them all, but there's basic 1d8 and 1d6 weapons in there, swords, axes, daggers, etc)
 - Scattered documents in plain text (1 slot)
 - Partially burned documents (1 slot, only if they attempt to put out the fire somehow: water, smothering it, etc)

 Hidden items:
 - Small lockbox (bulky, 2 slots. If opened contains documents detailing how to read the Cryptic Letters, 1 slot)
 - Ledgers of transactions (bulky, 2 slots)
 - Rolled up maps of the City (1 slot)

Towards the end of the search, more thugs will arrive. It will be tight quarters if they enter the shack, if players are smart they can keep them trapped in the fatal funnel of the door and fight them two on one, which could take advantage of the impaired/enhanced rule:

#### Thugs (x3)
HP: 3   Armor: 0  
STR: 10   DEX: 11   WIL: 8
 - Cudgel or Knife (1d6)

After dispatching the thugs:

_Ervig quickly surveys the chaos: "That will have to be good enough, let's get out of here before we're overwhelmed!" Burdened with whatever you could carry and still fight, you set out at a brisk walk in the direction of the Barracks. The streets are mercifully empty and you encounter no further resistance as you make your way out of the Slums. You all warily trudge back to the Barracks and wearily dump all the confiscated loot into the Duty Office. Ervig turns to you and speaks:_

_"Thanks for your help, that could've been much worse but thankfully we caught them off guard. I think with everything we were able to snatch out of there, I should be able to continue my investigation, and hopefully find out what's the reason for all this secrecy and widespread discontent. I won't make you sort though this mess with me, you've been more than helpful. Vandil assigned you to me for the entire day, and I'm dismissing you, which means you're free the rest of the day. Collect your wages from the Duty Officer here, and of course visit the Infirmary if you're injured. Rest up, you'll be needed again soon."_ 

### Search and Seizure: Conclusion
Players can collect their wages from the Duty Officer (5g). By now it's about noon, and the players are on downtime until next morning.

## 8: Do You Wish To Continue?
At this point in the Adventure, we're about to move onto the ending. If your players are having fun and don't want the adventure to end yet, this is a perfect point where you can can sort of "pause" the progress on the adventure as written, and continue doing your own Patrol assignments in the various Districts (Market, Residential, Dockside, Slums). Then you can continue onto the end of the adventure when you're ready!

I recommend asking the players what they want to do, but keep in mind that just because we're reaching the end of the written adventure, doesn't mean that the Players have to say goodbye to their characters if they don't want to. You're free to continue playing them, even in a different setting! It's all about what you all want to do together.

## 9: Into the Lion's Den
In this scenario players will be assisting Ervig again, following up on his findings from the safehouse raid. It won't be as hectic as the last raid, this will be a search of a merchant's estate.
 - Players will be searching room by room
 - TODO

_Morning arrives and you're all awake and ready to go, however no assignment has been posted yet. You remember on your first day you were told to find Lieutenant Vandil if no assignment was posted. As one you all head to the main foyer where the various administrative offices are located. You arrive to find Marcomir angrily heading to the exit, where he turns around and yells in the direction of Geberic's office: "Mark my words, if he gets his way it will be the end of you!", and with that he storms out of the Barracks._

_You turn and look for Vandil's office and you find Geberic, Vandil, and Ervig exchanging worried looks. As you all approach Vandil looks up and speaks: "Ah, apologies for not posting your assignment on time, something came up. I appreciate you seeking me out though, most of your peers would've just taken the opportunity to sleep in...". Ervig pipes up: "Actually... I may be able to use their help again today if they're available, Vandil." Lieutenant Vandil gives Ervig a sharp look: "Another smash and grab operation? Absolutely not, such an overt action would only worsen the situation!"._

_Ervig chuckles: "Oh no no, that worked for a run-down shack in the Slums, but I wouldn't dare use the same tactic on a private estate! No, I think something much more above-board, official, and civilized is in order." Ervig turns to Captain Geberic, who has been listening intently, keeping his silence: "Captain, would you say we have probable cause to conduct a search of the Henson Halmoor estate, in light of our recent findings from the decoded cryptic letters and the contents we were able to retrieve from raid?"_

_Geberic meets Ervig's gaze, and remains silent for another moment before finally answering: "It depends. Depends on who would be judging our actions in the event things don't turn out in our favor. Everyone in my office, now." He immediately turns and enters his office, with Vandil and Ervig in tow. You all follow and file in. Geberic sits at his desk and says: "Close the door".

_With a heavy sigh Geberic turns to look at you all, and speaks: "Let me get you up to speed on the situation. When you assisted Ervig on the safehouse raid, you were able to seize valuable evidence. We've been able to decode the cryptic letters that have been found, and it paints an interesting picture. To put it bluntly: Someone has been fanning the flames of unrest here in Eimgan, stirring up the populace in an attempt to incite a rebellion. Someone has been supplying arms to the downtrodden commonfolk, and I'm ashamed to admit that someone has managed to convince a surprising number of your peers to look the other way with substantial bribes."_

_"Someone with very deep pockets. As Ervig mentioned, we suspect Henson Halmoor, a prominent merchant here in the city. We found some coded letters that referenced someone called "The Benefactor" and although we've found nothing that directly links Henson Halmoor in this mess, there was an address that we decoded that is one of Halmoor's warehouses. Naturally we've already searched the warehouse but it was completely empty by the time we arrived." Geberic begins to massage his temples while he continues:_

_"You probably noticed Marcomir leaving in a particularly foul mood earlier, and for good reason. Halmoor has convinced the Magistrate that Marcomir is doing a terrible job, and has been making accusations of taking large amounts of levied taxes for himself, which of course isn't difficult to believe at all, you've seen the inside of his office. We've investigated this of course, much to the outrage of Marcomir, however everything checks out. His pay is signed off by the Magistrate herself, and everything is accounted for."_

_Geberic leans back in his chair and continues: "This rumor has also been spreading through the city, and angering the poor and destitute. We've had to station a few guards at the Tax and Excise Office full time. You may also know that we are funded by the Tax and Excise Office, and if Halmoor replaces Marcomir as the Head of Treasury, then we may not have the resources to do our duty of keeping the people of Eimgan safe."_ 

_Geberic exhales as he stands, and pauses, carefully considering his words: "Here's the reality: If we search Halmoor's Estate and we find nothing, it only fuels the unrest, potentially turning the people we're sworn to protect against us. If we do nothing and Halmoor is appointed Head of Treasury, then I honestly don't know what would happen. At the very least, we'd be out of job. At the very worst, we'd be tried as traitors and either be executed or rot in a cell for the rest of our lives." he looks to everyone in the room, and then at Ervig: "With that in mind, do you still feel we should conduct a search on Halmoor's home?" Ervig pauses a moment before answering with a nod: "Yes, Captain, I do."_

_Vandil speaks up: "Shall I draft an official search warrant for this auspicious occasion, Captain?" Geberic nods: "Yes, good thinking Vandil, thank you." He turns to Ervig once more: "What resources will you need to conduct this search?" Ervig answers without hesitation: "Just these fine guards at my back" he gestures to you all "and that fancy warrant to make it all official." Geberic chuckles and says: "Hah, so be it. You know what must be done so I'll leave you to it." he turns to you all: "Stick with Ervig and do us proud. Return to your quarters and make your preparations. I'll send Ervig to you once I've finished with him. Dismissed."_

Now players can make last minute inventory adjustments before they set out. 

_Ervig enters your quarters without knocking: "Alright well we know the stakes, let me give you a rundown on what to expect. This isn't like the raid in the Slums, there isn't going to be thugs rushing at us, and there's no time constraint. This is going to be excrutiatingly civil. Halmoor won't outright refuse any reasonable request, but he isn't going to make it easy for us. He's not stupid, so it we find something and it seems extremely convenient, it most likely means he wanted us to find it."_

_After a brief pause to think, Ervig continues: "I also highly advise we all stick together, and never lose eyesight of one another. Let me handle Halmoor, if we make any mistakes he'll take advantage of it, so don't try to steal anything from him or it will just end up badly for all of us. I think the best approach is to have you all searching, I'll be keeping an eye on Halmoor and any servants he has on hand, as well as keeping notes on anything we confiscate from him. We'll go room by room and search anything and everything. Any last questions before we make our way to the Halmoor Estate?"_

Players can ask any questions or make last minute adjustments, once they are ready, we continue:

_Ervig nods: "It's time, let's move." You head out as one, up the main street that separates the Market and Residential Districts, and then turn right to go deeper into the Residential District. As you walk you notice how your surroundings change, walking past small houses, and then larger houses, and now walking past manors with gated yards. Ervig leads you up to one of the largest manors, through an ornamental archway, and up the steps to the front door. He casts a sidelong glance at you and mutters "Here we go." and pounds loudly on the door with his fist. He shouts "Eimgan City Guard!" and takes a step back to wait for the door to open._

_After a few moments, the door opens to reveal a balding bearded man in a tabard with a confused smile: "Greetings protectors of Eimgan, welcome to the Halmoore Estate, uh how may I assist you?" he asks, clearly uncomfortable. Ervig hands him the warrant and says: "We've been authorized to conduct a search of the Halmoore Estate. I trust we'll have your full cooperation?"_

_The servant gingerly takes the warrant and stutters as he beings to read it: "W-well of course, I've no d-doubt the master will of course c-comply, i-if I may of course fetch him for you?" Before Ervig could respond, a jovial voice is heard behind the servant: "That won't be necessary my dear Teias", the servant quickly turns and bows, revealing a man approaching from behind him. The man sports a well trimmed goatee, and a dashing head of hair, wearing a flowing silk robe with rolled up sleeves, and an ornate sword sheathed at his hip. His face beaming as he gently takes the warrant from his servant: "It goes without saying that I will of course offer my full cooperation in this endeavor! Please, come in, and be welcome!"_

_Halmoor gestures and stands aside to allow you all to enter. You find yourself in what appears to be a waiting room, several ornate chairs and potted plants line the walls either side of the ornate door leading into the manor proper. Teias the servant turns to Halmoor and asks: "Shall I fetch refreshments for our guests?" who replies: "Not yet my good man, but thank you for asking." Halmoor turns to Ervig: "You have the look of one in charge, how may we best assist you my good sir?" he asks with a warm smile, as though he was greeting an old friend rather than being investigated by the authorities._

_Ervig returns a warm smiles and says: "The City Guard thank you for your warm reception and your courtesy Mr. Halmoor. I regret to say that we're here to conduct a search of your beautiful home. To ensure the best experience for both parties, I humbly request we conduct this search jointly, so that we may avoid any misunderstandings. In the event that we confiscate any of your effects, they will be catalogued and returned upon conclusion of any ongoing investigation or trial. We apologize for this inconvenience, and appreciate your understanding in this matter. Do you have anything to declare before we begin our search?"_

_Halmoor's smile widens as he answers: "Very good. The only thing I have to declare is you may find hidden stashes of coin and gems, all legitimately acquired and accounted for of course. They're safely tucked away in the event of a robbery, as well as maybe a few concealed weapons for protection. I see nothing in this warrant stating you'll need to confiscate such possessions, so I object to their confiscation. That being said, my servant and I shall remain on hand to assist you in this endeavor. Where would you like to begin your search?"_

_Ervig bows slightly and says: "Thank you for your cooperation. We'll begin our search here." Halmoor laughs: "The very soul of professionalism, bravo! Very well, search away!" Ervig turns to you all and gives the nod to get started searching. He walks to one side of the room and starts gently lifting cushions and searching anything in this room. You all spread out and start your search._

From here, players will be conducting and room-to-room search for anything out of the ordinary with Ervig, while Halmoor and Teias are watching. 
 - Teias and Ervig will be documenting anything that is found and taken by the players.
 - The Warden should keep a list of things found should players wish to review.
 - Each room will have a few things the players might find or notice, but not everything will be useful.
 - Halmoor is always smiling and courteous, and never betrays any hint of worry, fear, or frustration.
 - Halmoor will strongly object to any gems or coins being taken, and Ervig will tell the players to leave it be.
 - If Halmoor is asked a question, he was try to respond with as much useless detail as possible, such as old history, personal anecdotes, etc
 - Halmoor will make note of any wrongdoing the players may try to do (such as planting false evidence), but keep it to himself unless the players try to make a big deal out of it.
 - Important findings to the narrative will be marked with (Key Item), and Ervig will tell the players to confiscate it.
 - Every item occupies 1 inventory slot if they wish to confiscate it. (Unless bulky is specified)
 - Ervig can hold up to 6 slots if needed

 - Tucked behind the cot is a concealed dagger.
 - On the desk there is a small book which Teias uses to log his duties. (Key Item)

### Master Bedroom
Upon first entry:

_Halmoor leads you into a large, lavish, and well-lit bedroom: "Here are my private chambers, I've every confidence you will carry out your search with respect of my personal possessions." In the center of the room there is a very large ornate bed. Large windows allow natural light to crack through the partially-drawn curtains to illuminate multiple dressers, a few desks, and some decorations along the walls. In the center of the largest wall there is a decoration of a Golden Merchant's Scale that appears to represent the Halmoor's insignia._

Items of note:
 - The wall decoration of the  Merchant's Scale is tipped on the right side. If a player tips the other side so it is balanced, they will hear and feel a click. (This releases the lock on the Bed frame and allows it to easily roll out of the way if pushed)
 - In the desks there are some letters written to Halmoor from various other merchants. (Key Item)
 - Underneath Halmoor's bed is a hidden and secret trap door that leads to a small basement room.
 - Players cannot see underneath the bed frame, and if they try to move it they will find it is affixed to the floor.

### Lounge
Upon first entry:

_Teias leads you into a large dimly-lit room: "Here is the Lounge, where the Master and his guests can be entertained.". There are several comfortable padded chairs gathered around a small stage, with various music instruments resting on stands. A small bookshelf sits against a wall that is adorned by several paintings._

Items of note:
 - In the pages of one of the books, is a scandalous letter that appears to be from one of Halmoor's lovers.

### Hidden Vault
Upon discovery of the hidden trap door:

_Halmoor forces a smile as you easily roll the now-moveable bed out of the way to reveal a hidden trap door. "Ah, I didn't expect you to find this, well done!" You pull open the trap door to reveal a latter descending into a small room that is faintly lit by the natural light from the bedroom window. From above, you see several chests and a shelf._

Items of note:
 - Many chests loaded with hundreds of pouches containing coins and gems.
 - Stacks of Cryptic Letters. (Key Item, bulky)
 - A small book that details a newer more advanced cipher key for the Cryptic Letters (Key Item)
 - A stack of Ledgers (Key Item, bulky) These seem to have more detail than the ones found in the Study

## Into the Lion's Den Conclusion:
Once the players have completed the search to the best of their ability, read the following aloud:

_With the hour growing late and your search complete, Ervig, Teias, and Halmoor compare lists of the comfiscated items to ensure there are no descrepancies. Upon finding none, Ervig bows slightly to Halmoor and says: "Thank you once again for your cooperation in this matter. Enjoy the rest of your day." With that, you all journey back to the Barracks to the familiar confines of the Duty Office_

_Ervig helps you unload all the confiscated items on the desk and does one last verification with his list to ensure everything is there. Once completed, he turns to you all and breaths a sigh of relief: "Thank you once again for your help, to be honest I would've much preferred another Slums safehouse raid." He chuckles and continues: "Here take this." Ervig hands each of you 20 gold. "Vandil authorized a bonus for us since it is such a high-profile assignment, and with that you're released and can go rest."_

## The End
Determine which ending to read aloud based on the findings of the search:

If Halmoor's hidden vault was found and searched:

_In the days that followed the Search of the Halmoor Estate, Ervig, Vandil, and Geberic labored to decode and organize the evidance against Halmoor, who was brought to trial before the Magistrate. Unable to mount a credible defense under the weight of the evidence, the Magistrate judged him guilty, ordered him imprisoned, and seized his assets._

_Directly after Halmoor's sentencing, Marcomir received a promotion from the Magistrate. This resulted in the tax rate being raised, and the immediate disbanding of the Guards despite the protests of Captain Geberic and Lieutenant Vandil. The question of who will protect the people if the Guards are no more was quickly answered as outsourced Mercanaries assumed the mantle of "Protectors" of Eimgan, however they were far more concerned extorting taxes from the people rather than maintaining law and order._

_Suddenly unemployed, you're now free to do as you will. What adventures await you? Will you resist Marcomir's treachery and fight to restore the Guards? Will you find your fortune elsewhere? Or perhaps you'll save the world against an ancient evil? Whatever you choose to do, you know that you're much more prepared for whatever lay ahead than you were a few short weeks ago._


If the players failed to search the hidden vault:

_In the days that followed the Search of the Halmoor Estate, Ervig, Vandil, and Geberic labored to decode and organize the evidence against Halmoor, however there simply was nothing solid that implicated Halmoor beyond a shadow of a doubt, so no Trial was held. Later, for unknown reasons Marcomir resigned from his role as Head of Treasury, and the Magistrate appointed Halmoor in his stead._

_Upon being appointed Head of Treasury, Halmoor immediately ceased all funding of the City Guard, and instead outsourced a band of Mercanaries to assume the role of "Protectors" of Eimgan. Geberic was immediately arrested, and every Guard was out of a job. Halmoor increased the tax rate and used his Mercanaries to arrest anyone who spoke out against him._

_Suddenly unemployed, you're now free to do as you will. What adventures await you? Will you resist Halmoor's treachery and try to rescue Geberic? Will you find your fortune elsewhere? Or perhaps you'll save the world against an ancient evil? Whatever you choose to do, you know that you're much more prepared for whatever lay ahead than you were a few short weeks ago._
