# Raw PDFs
I create each page in befunky (It's an image editor that I'm familiar with) which has the option to export as a PDF, however it is individual files. I use https://combinepdf.com to combine them into a single cohesive PDF, but it only allows 20 files at a time, so currently the workly is to do the first 0-19 pages, make that a file, then add additional pages to that, etc.

Once I have a complete PDF, I make it a booklet using https://online2pdf.com/create-booklet-flipbook which handles it all for me. For this to work properly, I think the total page count has to be a multiple of 4, in order for the front and back covers to be printed on the same side of a page.
