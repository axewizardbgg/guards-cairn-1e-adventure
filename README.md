# “Guards” an Adventure for Cairn 1e
Written by Axe Wizard

## About the Adventure
The Adventure takes place in the city of Eimgan, and potentially the surrounding remote villages of Clurgh and Ontstead. Players will play the role of City Guards for the city of Eimgan, and they will face various encounters and scenarios. 

This adventure has been written with the intent of using theater of the mind, so it will not include any battle maps, however Stat Blocks will be included.

Each Patrol assignment will usually have a few suggestions for harmless scenarios, and one important scenario that may resolve in a chase, arrest, investigation, or combat! Encounters will provide a few key details (usually in bullet points) that you as the Warden can use to freely describe events as you see fit.

In the event of Character Death, the player's character will be buried with honors, and they will roll another character as a fresh recruit to fill in.
