# “Guards” an Adventure for Cairn 1e
Written by Axe Wizard

## About the Adventure
The Adventure takes place in the city of Eimgan, and potentially the surrounding remote villages of Clurgh and Ontstead. Players will play the role of City Guards for the city of Eimgan, and they will face various encounters and scenarios. 

This adventure has been written with the intent of using theater of the mind, so it will not include any battle maps, however Stat Blocks will be included.

Each Patrol assignment will usually have a few suggestions for harmless scenarios, and one important scenario that may resolve in a chase, arrest, investigation, or combat! Encounters will provide a few key details (usually in bullet points) that you as the Warden can use to freely describe events as you see fit.

## Starting Instructions
When guiding your players through Character creation you can simply follow the standard Cairn 1e rules, with the only exceptions being do not have them roll for the Clothing trait, or for Armor, Helmets, and Shields, or Weapons. 

Each player will start with the following, as it is the standard Uniform for an Eimgan City Guard:
 - Brigandine Armor (Bulky) = 1 Armor
 - Sword (1d8)
 - Manacles

Players can select or randomize everything else as normal, and even choose to spend their starting gold on additional equipment as they see fit. (For example if they wish to have a helmet, shield, or additional weapons, they can purchase those with their own funds, but it will not be issued to them)

If there is only one player, the Warden is encouraged to roll an NPC to be the player’s Partner. They will have the same issued equipment (Brigandine and Sword). The NPC can be played by the Warden, and it will follow the Player’s lead, however the Warden can use the NPC to warn the Player of danger, or suggest ideas should the Player struggle.

Finally, any text written in _italics_ are intended to be read aloud to the players

## Intro
Once the Players have rolled their characters and are satisfied with their starting equipment, we can begin!

_Our story begins with you anxiously waiting outside the office of Guard Captain Geberic. You each are standing at attention facing the stout oak door awaiting to officially report for duty as new City Guards of Eimgan. Lieutenant Vandil is giving you instructions in an uninterested tone, as though he was bored: “The Great City of Eimgan appreciates your initiative and valor for joining the City Guard. Captain Geberic will take your oaths and officially swear you in, and give you your initial briefing momentarily. You may stand at ease until that door opens.”_

_Before you can even relax your stance, the door swings open outward from the room, and in the door stands a man of medium height and athletic build. What little hair he has left is flecked with grey, and his weathered skin creases in a smile as he addresses you in a gravelly voice:_

_“Look at you standing at attention, outstanding discipline! We’re going to get along great, I can already tell. Come in, come in.” He stands aside and gestures for you to enter._

_As you enter you see a line drawn on the floor in front of his desk. You instinctively toe the line and stand once more at attention. You hear the thud of the heavy door closing behind you, and footsteps as the man walks around to his desk, eyeing you as he rests his hands on his chair facing you. He speaks:_

_“Good, good. Already kitted out and didn’t even have to be told to toe the line. Excellent. Be at ease, relax.”. He takes his seat as you relax your stance, shrugging off the stiffness of standing inert for so long._

_“I am Captain Geberic as you’re probably already aware, and today you become official protectors of the City of Eimgan. Before I take your oaths, do you have any questions of me?”_

Give the players an opportunity to speak if they wish. Geberic is a seasoned soldier who appreciates questions and will answer as best he can, however he will not take kindly to jokes or nonsense.

Once any questions have been answered, you may continue:

_“Are you ready to take the Protector’s Oath?” Geberic asks you nonchalantly, however his eyes are shrewdly observing your reactions, waiting for any hesitation. Seeing none as you all voice “Yes Captain” brings a smile to his face._

_“Excellent!” he exclaims, beaming at you as he stands proudly and begins to unravel a well-worn parchment. You instinctively snap to the position of attention._

Geberic is about to recite the oath and the players should repeat after him. Feel free to break it down into 3-5 word bursts for easier memory if needed.

_“Repeat after me” commands Geberic, in a well practiced ceremonial voice: “I pledge my Strength and Valor to safeguard the people of this City”_

If the players do not repeat the first line of the oath, Captain Geberic looks at them pointedly and repeats it again with a hard stare.

_“I shall uphold Justice, protect the weak, and maintain order”_

_“I vow to stand as a shield against threats, both within and beyond our walls”_

_“I will not waver in the face of danger, nor falter in my duty”_

_“I embrace this responsibility as a protector of the people”_

_“And I will serve with honor and integrity.”_

_“This I swear”_

_Captain Geberic allows the parchment to roll itself back up as he places it back on his desk. “Remember your oaths, and do your best. These are troubled times and you are needed more than ever. This is not a job for the weak, not many would volunteer to do what you do, hold your heads high and proud, and bring honor to this uniform.”_

_Geberic slowly exhales as he walks around to the front of his desk. “Relax, relax. Now let me brief you on your duties”. He lounges on the edge of his desk, crossing his arms, leaning in as he speaks in an unexpected soft voice:_

_“I’ll be honest, it’s a dangerous job, now more so than ever before. There’s a very real chance you may fall in the line of duty, but that is what we do. You’ll be assigned as a team, you’ll work together, and I advise you all to stick together. A lone guard is a dead guard. Look out for each other and keep everyone safe.”_

_He sighs as he straightens slightly, his voice returning back to his normal gruff gravelly tone “Shifts will be rotating periodically, for now you’ll be on duty from nightfall to dawn. Normally I’d assign you daylight hours, and place a senior guard with you to guide you until you feel more confident, but we’re already undermanned as it is.”_

_He looks at each of you and grins: “On a good note though, if you make it through your first shift unharmed, you’ll have some serious bragging rights in the barracks!” He laughs as he stands up and walks around you to the door._

_“Rest up, your first shift is tonight. You’ll be shown to your quarters and you’ll find your assignment posted on the board outside your door. Don’t be late! I’ll let you get to your preparations, and I know you’ll make me proud” He opens the door and waves you out of his office, where you are met once again by Lieutenant Vandil_

_“I’ll show you to your quarters. Expect to have your assignment posted on your assignment board before your watch begins. In the event there is no assignment posted, you are to see me directly”_

_Vandil leads you through the barracks to your assigned quarters. As you pass through the halls you can see your fellow guardsmen, attending to various tasks while they are off duty. Some are caring for their arms and armor, some are dressing wounds, some are fast asleep, and others are playing various games involving dice or cards. Some of them glance up and meet your gaze as you pass. Some smile, some nod, some ignore you and go back to what they’re doing._

_One thing you notice from all of them though, is that they are all tired and sporting various scars. You wonder just what exactly you signed up for, but your thoughts are interrupted as Vandil halts before a rough wooden door with a small posting board to the left of the doorway._

_“Here are your quarters. As the Captain already advised you, you are a single unit, a team. Inside you’ll find your cots with clean linens ready for use. You are expected to maintain your quarters, just as you will your arms and armor. Should you have any questions, see Barracks Sergeant Gelimer. I’d advise getting some rest before your first assignment!” And with that, he brusquely walks back the way he came, leaving you to your quarters._

With the intro concluded, the players have the entire day to themselves before their first watch tonight. They may use this time to get to know one another if they wish to roleplay, or may simply wish to rest and start their first watch. 

Note that even though they were advised to rest, players should not be Fatigued or Deprived for their first watch even if they chose not to rest.

## 1: Market District
 - Players will be patrolling around the Markets during the night. 
 - All the shops should be closed, and there should be almost nobody on the streets at this time. 
 - Keep in mind eyesight will be poor, and at least one player should be holding a torch if they are to see anything at all.

_As you are readying yourselves for the coming patrol, you hear the sound of a hammer driving a nail into the Assignment Board outside your quarters. You crowd around your assignment board reading the few short words scribbled on a parchment: “Market District”. It’s not much to go off of, but you know what you’re supposed to do. Oaths fresh in your minds you set out together to the Market District to start your patrol._

Players will most likely be on alert, so be sure to inform them of any sounds they might hear. The players should encounter some harmless scenarios during the patrol, such as:
 - A stray animal
 - A tired shopkeeper leaving late
 - Street kids out and about after Curfew
 - Signs of Vandalism

One of the things they should investigate before the night is over, is a burglary in progress! 
 - Players can be alerted by a sound, or furtive movement. 
 - As they investigate, the burglar will try to hide or flee. 
 - If confronted the burglar will try to lie. 
 - If all else fails, the burglar will fight just enough to try to break free and run. 
 - If the players catch and restrain the burglar, he will give up and allow himself to be arrested.

#### Burglar
Name: "Dags" (if he lies, he'll say his name is Henson Halmoor, a prominent merchant)  
HP: 4  Armor: 0  
STR: 9   DEX: 14   WIL: 10
 - Dagger (1d6)
 - Rope (25ft)
 - Lockpicks
 - Crowbar
 - Coin purse containing 4d6 Gold
 - Stolen Merchandise (bulky)
 - Cryptic Letter (the words make no sense, some type of code, unreadable)

### Market District: Conclusion
Once the shift is ending, the players will head back to the Barracks and see the Duty Officer to report anything of note they encountered while on patrol.

_With the sun now beginning to rise, signaling the end of your first patrol, you make your way back to the Barracks to report to the Officer on Duty. You walk into the Duty Office to find a uniformed man dozing off in a chair, seated behind a desk. The man’s eyes pop open as your footsteps echo off the walls. He straightens in his chair and reaches for quill and parchment._

_“Must be dawn already, let’s see… you were the Market District patrol, yes? Anything to report?”_

Here the players can give their report. 
 - If they arrested the Burglar, the Duty Officer will have two other stationed guards take the burglar away.  
 - If the Cryptic Letter is given to the Duty Officer, he will accept it with a shrug, and place it somewhere on his desk.

Once everything has been discussed, the Duty Officer will pay each player 5 gold, and advise the players to get some rest, and visit the Infirmary should they require healing.

### Downtime
Now the players have some time to themselves before their next patrol. Common activities players may wish to do in their downtime:
 - Visit the markets and buy weapons, armor, supplies, and items
 - Visit the Infirmary to heal any wounds (Normally healing wounds would take several days or weeks depending on the severity, but for the purposes of this adventure the Infirmary can treat any wounds within a matter of hours through rare magical means)
 - Roleplay with one another, including pursuing any personal backstories or other errands/tasks the players may have.
 - Rest up and proceed immediately to the next assignment.

## 2: Residential District
 - Players will be patrolling around the Residential district during the night. 
 - The streets should be empty and most lights should be out in the various windows of the neighborhood, but there still may be some people about. 
 - Keep in mind eyesight will be poor, and at least one player should be holding a torch if they are to see anything at all.

_As you are readying yourselves for your second patrol, you hear the sound of a hammer driving a nail into the Assignment Board outside your quarters. You crowd around your assignment board reading the few short words scribbled on a parchment: “Residential District''. Looks like another standard evening patrol. At least you’re not as nervous this time as you have a better idea of what to expect. You set out together to the Residential District to start your patrol._

Players will most likely be on alert, so be sure to inform them of any sounds they might hear. Have them investigate a few things that turn out to be harmless, here are some ideas you can throw at them:
 - A drunkard shambling home
 - Someone emptying a chamber pot out a window
 - A tired baker leaving their house for work before dawn
 - Two neighbors arguing over a barking dog

One of the things they should investigate before the night is over, is a domestic disturbance. The players will hear a man shouting, and a woman screaming. As the players go to investigate the source of the noise, read the following aloud:

_As you approach the source of the disturbance, you see shadowed movement ahead of you, and you hear a man’s voice screaming “Help me please, he’s going to kill me!” followed by rapid footsteps coming your way._

From here, let the players try to figure out what the hell is happening. 
 - This first man (named Thidrek) is completely naked, clutching a bundle of clothes and looking terrified. 
 - He is pursued by an angry man (named Candac)
 - A hysterical woman (named Aleyda) is trying to restrain Candac. 

Candac came home late and found Thidrek in bed with his wife Aleyda, and thus was chasing Thidrek in a blind rage.

Including stat blocks for all because wow, this scenario can get crazy! Here are some things to note:
 - Thidrek wants to stay as far away from Candac as possible, and will take off running the first chance he gets. 
 - Candac will become enraged and attack if the players side with Thidrek, and may potentially strike Aleyda if Thidrek is arrested or killed. 
 - Aleyda is hysterical and begging Candac to calm down, and she will scream and attack the players if anything bad happens to Candac (even if Candac strikes her).

#### Thidrek
HP: 2   Armor: 0  
STR: 9    DEX: 12    WIL: 15
 - Unarmed (1d4)
 - Bundle of Clothes

#### Candac
HP: 5   Armor: 0  
STR: 12   DEX: 9   WIL: 12
 - Cudgel (1d6)
 - Empty Wineskin
 - Coin purse containing 2d6 Gold

#### Aleyda
HP: 2   Armor: 0  
STR: 8   DEX: 11   WIL: 10
 - Unarmed (1d4)
 - Linen Bed Sheet

### Residential District: Conclusion
As it was with the first Patrol, the players will make their way back to the Barracks to the Duty Office and make their report. Once the report is complete, each player will receive 5 gold and then will be on Downtime until their next Assignment.

If any arrests were made, the Duty Officer will take custody and handle the process from there

## 3: Dockside District
 - Players will be patrolling around the Dockside district during the night. 
 - The streets are actually fairly lively late into the evening. 
 - The populace will consist mostly of sailors and deckhands who grow rowdier as the evening goes on. 
 - Keep in mind eyesight will be poor, and at least one player should be holding a torch if they are to see anything at all.

_The familiar sound of a hammer striking a nail into your Assignment Board interrupts your thoughts as you all shuffle out of your room to look at your next assignment: “Dockside District”. You gather your equipment and head out, feeling more confident now that you’ve got a few patrols under your belt, but you can’t help but feel nervous, as you know the Dockside District is one of the rowdiest and most dangerous areas of the city._

Players will be on alert, however there are going to be many sights and sounds happening from rowdy sailors, tavern wenches, and belligerent deckhands. 
 - The player characters would have knowledge that Tavern Brawls are a common occurrence that isn’t illegal, but murder or destruction of property certainly is.

Ease the players in with a few harmless things, here are some ideas:
 - Some patrons of a tavern having a fistfight while a crowd cheers (fistfights aren't illegal)
 - Drunken sailors stumbling around
 - Angry conversation about how those in power mistreat the lower class, and people have about had enough
 - Someone passed out in the street snoring loudly
 - Perhaps the players see something floating in the water, such as an empty crate

One of the things they should investigate before the night is over is a particularly violent fight in a tavern. The players will hear the sound of angry shouting, breaking glass, wood splintering, and the ring of steel. When they arrive on the scene you can read the following aloud:

_As you arrive at the scene of chaos, you quickly survey the surroundings and take in the situation. The first thing you notice immediately is two men hacking at each other with cutlasses, and one man is bleeding from a wound on his arm, staining his shirt with a growing blotch of crimson. The gathered crowd has given the combatants a wide berth, and the Tavern Keeper is shouting for them to stop as one combatant throws a wooden stool at the other. The Tavern Keeper sees you and implores you to intercede._

The players should try to break up the fight to prevent any more bloodshed or property damage, but may have to defend themselves depending on how the scenario develops. 
 - Neither combatant will drop their weapon while the other still holds theirs. 
 - They won’t attack a Player unless a Player attacks them. 
 - If a Player attacks one of the combatants with a weapon (attempts to grapple or restrain are fine), other people in the crowd may get involved. 
 - Should the crowd get involved they are considered a Detachment, and if a player takes critical damage, the Tavern Keeper will step in and persuade the Crowd to disperse (reasoning that if they kill any guards they’ll all be hanged when word gets out). 
 - If the crowd gets involved, the combatants will both flee.

#### Narin (Combatant #1)
HP: 6   Armor: 0  
STR: 11   DEX: 12   WIL 9
 - Cutlass (1d8)
 - Pulley
 - Empty coin purse

#### Rodolf (Combatant #2, Wounded)
HP: 0/6   Armor: 0  
STR: 7/9   DEX: 11   WIL: 13
 - Cutlass (1d8)
 - Loaded Dice Set
 - Coin purse containing 3d20 Gold

#### Crowd (Detachment, refer to Cairn ruleset)
HP: 4
STR: 7   DEX: 9   WIL 13
 - Unarmed (1d4, 1d12 blast if enhanced)
 - Crowd will disperse and run if they take critical damage

### Dockside District: Conclusion
As it was with the previous Patrols, the players will make their way back to the Barracks to the Duty Office and make their report. Once the report is complete, each player will receive 5 gold and then will be on Downtime until their next Assignment.

## 4: Missing Tax Collector
 - Players will be given additional downtime to prepare for their next assignment. 
 - Investigate the missing whereabouts of  a Tax Collector who was tasked to to collect taxes from the villages of Clurgh and Ontstead. 
 - This mission will take several in-game days to complete.

_As you are all doing final checks on your gear waiting for your assignment to be posted, you’re all startled by your door opening. As your heads snap in the door’s direction you find Lieutenant Vandil looking through a sheaf of parchment._

_“Consider this a rare opportunity to excel. I was going to assign you to patrol the Slums District tonight, but something of greater priority has arisen. You will rest until the morning, where you will meet a gentleman by the name of Marcomir Frithilla at the Tax and Excise office.”_

_“Marcomir will brief you on the particulars, but from what I understand, some Tax Collector has gone missing, and naturally they wish to find out what happened to him…”  He shrewdly looks at each of you. “Hmm, or perhaps they’re more concerned about the taxes he potentially collected?”_

_He chuckles and shakes his head. “Well you have your orders. You have until the morning to rest more, if you wish. After you’ve spoken to Marcomir, be sure to see Quartermaster Berig here in the Barracks, he shall see you’re outfitted with supplies before you set off.”_

Now the players have some downtime, however since it is evening now, shops and marketplaces will be closed, however a Tavern or two will certainly be open should they wish to indulge.

When they finally go to meet Marcomir, you can read this aloud:

_You proceed to the Tax and Excise office as ordered. Upon entering you’re greeted by a dingy interior, smelling of dust and old parchment. You see a balding clerk at a table looking up at you from his work. He speaks in a faltering tone:_

_“Oh you must be the Investigators, come right this way, I’ll show you to Marcomir’s office.” He swings his feet around and grabs a nearby cane, and starts limping slowly toward an unexpectedly lavish door of a beautiful dark stained wood, with a glossy varnish. Upon reaching it he opens the door and pokes his head in, only to be greeted with a loud irritated voice: “What is it now?”_

_“Apologies for the interruption, but the Investigators you requested have arrived.”_

_“Excellent, show them in at once.” the voice says._

_The Clerk opens the door wider and stands to one side to allow you to pass into the office of Marcomir. Your vision is immediately assaulted by the gaudy opulence of not only Marcomir, but everything within the office. The desk he sits behind is another beautiful dark stained wood, yet this has golden inlays with artistic shapes and accents. Several display cases line the wall either side of the doorway, and a bookshelf packed with books along the back wall. From above, light floods in through ornate stained glass windows casting a myriad of colors across everything._

_Marcomir himself is dressed in a black and gold robe with a feathered beret that is also black and gold. He stands from his chair which is the size of a small throne and throws his arms wide: “Excellent, I knew Geberic wouldn’t let me down, we do pay your wages after all” he smirks looking at each of you. “I know, extravagant isn’t it? Well pick your jaws up off the floor, we’ve business to discuss!” You hear the sound of the clerk closing the door behind you. “Normally I’d invite you to sit but…” he looks at your armor “I’d rather you not damage my priceless furniture. I’ll make it brief”._

_He brings his hands together in a steeple in front of him as he pauses dramatically. “One of my subordinate collectors, a man named Bragen, is missing. Understand me clearly: I care nothing for this man. What I do care about however, is the taxes that were collected. I’ve reason to believe Bragen absconded with the gold. I want it back.”_

_“In addition to your regular daily wages you’ll earn, I’ll pay you each 30 gold for the return of collected taxes, with proof that it was the full amount that was collected, otherwise you’d probably just skim a bit off the top for yourselves. We keep ledgers, so Bragen most likely has one. I’ll throw in another 20 for gold for each of you if you also discover proof that Bragen did indeed commit this theft and you bring him before me so he may stand trial and be sentenced.”_

_“Have you any questions?” He asks, looking at each of you._

At this point the players can ask any questions if they need clarification. 
 - Marcomir will grow more irritated and condescending with each question. 
 - All he wants is the money returned with proof, and Bragen to be brought before him if possible.
 - He recommends the Players go to Clurgh first.

Once the players are done speaking with Marcomir, they’ll obtain supplies from the Barracks. Each player will receive
 - 3 days Rations (1 slot)
 - Small field tent (1 slot) (Houses only 1 player, personal tent)
 - The group as a whole will receive a Mule (6 slots, slow) that is intended to be used to haul any recovered taxes back to the city.

Once equipped, the players will set out a few hours before noon. It is a half day’s journey to either Clurgh or Ontstead, and about the same between the two villages.

### Clurgh
During the course of the Player’s investigation of Clurgh, they will find that the populace is wary of the Players, and won’t divulge any information regarding Bragen freely. The players can try to persuade, coerce, or bribe people for information. Key individuals that have useful information are:
 - Hralgor, the Tavern Keeper (Bragen flaunts his wealth and demeans tavern patrons)
 - Mortimer, the Village Elder (Bragen is dishonest, and takes advantage of simple folk)
 - Gertrude, a random villager (Bragen was last seen departing for Ontstead)

What the players should eventually learn is that Bragen was taking advantage of illiterate villagers and taking more than he should have been, and pocketing the extra. Bragen was last seen setting out for Ontstead.

### Ontstead
During the course of the Player’s investigation of Ontstead, they will find that the populace is wary of the Players' presence, and won’t talk freely without being persuaded to. Key individuals that have useful information are:
 - Conrad, the Tavern Keeper (Bragen was seen, but didn’t stop in for his usual ale before departing)
 - Cecilia, a Tanner (Bragen had already collected taxes from her)
 - Samuel, a Blacksmith (Bragen hasn’t collected taxes from him yet)

Once the players have all the pieces, they’ll overhear someone talking about a man named Ardveg, who is a hunter, was able to afford an expensive cure for his wife’s ailment.

_“Did you hear that Ardveg was finally able to afford the cure for his dear Helva? She’s still a bit weak but she definitely seems to be on the mend. I wonder though… Where did he get the money? Oh well I suppose it's none of my business, just glad Helva’s going to be okay”_

If the players follow this thread, they’ll discover Ardveg had had enough of Bragen trying to extort him with his wife dying, and murdered Bragen.
 - If players confront Ardveg, he’ll confess everything and beg for the players to leave him be, as he only did it to stop Bragen from terrorizing others and to save his dying wife.
 - Ardveg will offer to take the Players to where he disposed of Bragen. 
 - If the players decide to arrest Ardveg, he’ll fly into a rage and fight to the death.
 - If Ardveg dies before he shows the Players where he hid Bragen, they won’t find anything and will return empty-handed.

#### Ardveg
HP: 6   Armor: 1  
STR: 12   DEX: 14   WIL: 12
 - Hunting Bow (1d8 when wielded by Ardveg, else only 1d6)
 - Skinning Knife (1d6)
 - Handaxe (1d8) (If melee, Ardveg will dual wield Handaxe and Knife)
 - Empty coin purse
 - Smelly Hide Armor (1 Armor)

If the players find the corpse of Bragen, they’ll find the following:
 - Heavy Lockbox (extremely bulky, takes up 4 slots, contains 2,195 gold (50 gold missing))
 - Tax Ledger (states that collected amount should total 2,245 gold)
 - Journal (states that Bragen pocketed 237 extra gold that is not on the ledgers)
 - Heavy Satchel (contains 237 gold)

Players shouldn’t be penalized if they decide to keep the extra gold Bragen stole. Marcomir is only concerned with what’s on the ledger.

### Missing Tax Collector: Conclusion
Because there’s so many ways the players could decide to handle this, I’ll cover some bases:

If the players decide to take the money and run:
 - The written adventure ends here, you’re on your own!
 - Wanted posters will be circulated throughout the region
 - Bounty Hunters will be hired to track them down.
 - Enjoy the chaos!

If the players decide to return to Eimgan:
 - The players should journey back to Eimgan and report to Marcomir (preferably with the Heavy Lockbox and the Ledger).
 - If the amount returned matches the amount listed in the ledger, Marcomir will pay each player 30 gold.
 - If the players brought back the corpse of Bragen, Marcomir will be disgusted, and demand proof of Bragen’s misconduct. If no proof is provided, no bonus gold is received.
 - Should the Players try to forge false proof of Bragen's attempt to run off with the gold, Marcomir will still accept it and pay the Players the promised bonus, as he hates the man.
 - Should the amount specified in the Ledger and the amount returned not match, Marcomir will inform Geberic, and Geberic will have other guards search the Players.
 - If Marcomir has Geberic search the players, and they find an excess of missing funds they pocketed, they will be arrested and jailed. If jailed, the written adventure is over, but you're still free to keep playing! Jailbreaks, on the run as criminals, could be fun!

Once business with Marcomir is concluded, the players should return to the Duty Office in the Barracks and receive daily wages for every day they were gone. (Should be about 2 day’s worth at least) From there Lieutenant Vandil will speak with them:

_“Good you’re back. Thank you for completing that investigation. I’ve authorized each of you to take a day off for recuperation, and then it will be back to standard night watch for you all. I’ll post your patrol assignment on your board.”_

Players are now on Downtime to do as they wish.

## 5: Slums District
 - Players will be patrolling around the Slums during the night. 
 - There will be ramshackle shelters strewn throughout the streets. 
 - Crime is most prominent here and Guards are not well-liked. 
 - Keep in mind eyesight will be poor, and at least one player should be holding a torch if they are to see anything at all.

_You crowd around your assignment board reading the few short words scribbled on a parchment: “Slums District”. You all look to one another, feeling disappointment after such a lowly assignment after the excitement of your previous investigation assignment. After checking your gear, you all head out to the stench of the Slums District to do your patrol._

Players will be on alert, and the Slums will be fairly active in the evening hours. As the evening progresses to early morning there will be less and less people about. 

As always give the players a few harmless scenarios such as:
 - Two men having a loud verbal argument
 - A homeless vagrant sleeping in the middle of the street
 - Beggars asking the players to take pity on them and spare them a coin
 - Desparate souls crowding around a cart of someone freely giving food to the people

One of the things they should encounter before the night is over is a cutpurse swipes the coin purse of one of the players! Select a player to be the target (how you decide this is up to you) and then read the following:

_As you turn a corner on your patrol, <player name>, you feel a slight rustle at your hip. You quickly turn and look to find a dirty man with a small dagger clutching your coin purse he just cut from you. He's already turning to run._

At this point have the player make a DEX save to see if they can grab the cutpurse’s arm before they can flee out of range.
 - If the cutpurse is restrained by a player, they cannot flee unless they succeed at a DEX save. 
 - If multiple players are restraining them, they will need to succeed at a STR save. 
 - If players use an item or have some way to restrain the cutpurse other than their strength (Rope, Manacles, Chain, Twine, etc), the cutpurse will give up and go quietly.
 - Should the cutpurse escape and the players give chase, the cutpurse should run into an armed man, who is demanding the cutpurse give him his money back. 
 - If the players managed to apprehend the cutpurse before he can flee, the armed man will walk up to them and demand they hand over the cutpurse to him.
 - The armed man will try to take the target player’s coin purse that the thief stole, and will attack the players if they intervene.

#### Nelman (Cutpurse)
HP: 2   Armor: 0  
STR: 8   DEX: 12   WIL: 9
 - Dagger (1d6)
 - Player’s coin purse (If not yet retrieved)
 - Dark clothing

#### Groldar (Angry Victim)
HP: 6   Armor: 1

### Slums District: Conclusion
Players will make their way back to the Barracks to the Duty Office and make their report. Once the report is complete, each player will receive 5 gold. However, Lieutenant Vandil will intercept them and task them with an immediate assignment!

## 6: Main Gate
 - This assignment immediately follows the previous one, and as such Players will be considered Deprived.
 - It will be during the day, so visibility will be unimpaired.
 - Players will be monitoring who enters and exits the city.

_As you all head back to your quarters in the Barracks, Lieutenant Vandil hurriedly intercepts you._

_“I hate to spring this on you all, I know you just finished the night watch, but I need you to relieve the  guards at the Main Gate immediately. They’ll brief you on your duties when you arrive. I’ll try to find a replacement for you but expect to be on duty the entire day. I’ll make sure you all get a small bonus when you report to the Duty Office when you’re relieved.”_

_Before you can reply or ask questions, Lieutenant Vandil moves along rummaging through sheaves of parchment and muttering curses underneath his breath. You all look to one another, exhausted from patrolling the Slums all night, and dejectedly set off to the Main Gate_

_As you arrive you see three of your fellow guards perk up at your arrival. One of them, a raven-haired woman greets you: “You here to relieve us? Our relief never showed up and we’ve been here all night.” Seeing you all nod a huge smile creases through her battered face. “About time, my feet are killing me.”_

_She looks at each of you “I haven’t seen you all posted here before, so let me brief you on what to do: It’s simple, check everyone who is trying to enter the city. Any mules, horses, wagons, packs, and crates are to be searched for contraband. If you get a bad feeling about anyone, you can deny them entry. If anyone makes a big fuss or says they’re important and threatens to get you fired or something silly like that, one of you should wake up old Lieutenant Connor who lives upstairs in the Gatehouse. That old bloke knows everyone who is anyone in this city and can quickly sort out that nonsense. Any questions?”_

Here the players can ask any questions, but really there isn’t any more to be said:
 - Check anyone entering the city, if players feel they have ill intent or don’t belong, they can turn them away.
 - Search any containers for contraband (what qualifies as "contraband" is up to you, but usually things like large caches of weapons, illegal substances, etc).
 - Wake up Lieutenant Connor in the Gatehouse if someone demands to speak to your superiors

_The weary guard motions to her comrades “Alright we’re off to finally get some rest, good luck out there!”, and they all trudge off in the direction of the barracks. You’re officially on duty at the Main Gate!_

Here the players are standing guard at the Main Gate:
 - It is daytime, no torches or light sources are needed.

Give the players a few innocent scenarios such as:
 - Legitimate trader with a donkey laden with trade goods.
 - Group of farmers from Clurgh coming to get supplies.
 - A Newcomer to the city asking the players for directions or where to find goods and services.
 - Pompous man who refuses to be searched and demands to "speak with the supervisor"
 - Official Courier galloping towards the gate

During their shift, they’ll encounter a “merchant” with a wagon full of goods pulled by two horses.
 - If the players try to search the cart, the man will attempt to bribe the players with 25 gold total to let him pass (He’ll haggle all the way to a total of 100 gold).
 - If the players refuse the bribe (or change their mind after receiving the bribe), the man will be visibly angry but stand aside and allow the search.
 - There is nothing wrong with the cargo inside the wagon (It’s all foodstuffs), however underneath the wagon, there is some crates in a hidden storage area that contain an alarming amount of weapons (swords and crossbows) padded with clothing and bedding to keep it quiet.
 - If the players find the concealed weapons, the man will attack!
 - If the man attacks, he will fight to the death.
 - If a player goes down, Relief Guards will show up and intervene

#### Merciless Merchant
HP: 6   Armor: 2   
STR: 14   DEX: 13   WIL: 10
 - Chainmail Armor (Concealed beneath light robe): 2 Armor
 - Poison Dagger (1d6 damage, Critical Damage: Poisons target). If poisoned, the target must make a WIL save each turn until they succeed (even if unconscious). Upon failure, they take 1 additional damage that ignores Armor.
 - Throwing Daggers x3 (1d6, ranged)
 - Coin Purse containing 100 gold (-25 gold if bribe was given)
 - Cryptic Letter (the words make no sense, some type of code, unreadable)

#### Relief Guards (3 total)
HP: 4   Armor: 1  
STR: 12   DEX: 10   WIL: 10
 - Sword (1d8)
 - Bow (1d6)

### Main Gate: Conclusion
Once the scenario with the Merciless Merchant has concluded (whether or not the players searched the cart): 
 - Guards sent to relieve you will arrive. (Unless arrival was already triggered earlier by a player going unconscious)

If players allowed the merchant through:
 - Nothing special happens (right now), they can return to the Barracks

If players fought the Merciless Merchant:
 - Lieutenant Connor is awoken by the commotion and advises players to take the merchant (dead or alive) to the Duty Office, along with the cart and its contents.

Regardless of how it turned out:
 - Upon returning to the Barracks and reporting to Duty Officer, players will each receive a total of 10 gold each, 5 for normal duty, and 5 for a bonus from Lieutenant Vandil.
 - If the Cryptic Letter is given to the Duty Officer, he will add it to a growing pile of similar letters. If the players ask about the letters, he'll say it's being investigated.
 - Players are now on Downtime until the next morning.

## 7: Cryptic Investigation
 - Players will be aiding an investigation into the Cryptic Letters
 - TODO

## 8: Do You Wish To Continue?
At this point in the Adventure, we're about to move onto the ending. If your players are having fun and don't want the adventure to end yet, this is a perfect point where you can can sort of "pause" the progress on the adventure as written, and continue doing your own Patrol assignments in the various Districts (Market, Residential, Dockside, Slums). Then you can continue onto the end of the adventure when you're ready!

I recommend asking the players what they want to do, but keep in mind that just because we're reaching the end of the written adventure, doesn't mean that the Players have to say goodbye to their characters if they don't want to. You're free to continue playing them, even in a different setting! It's all about what you all want to do together.

## 9: Attacked Caravan
This is assignment will be a bit more difficult, not only potentially for the players, but also you as the Warden. There is quite a lot of dialogue to be read aloud, and quite a few NPCs involved!

_Morning arrives and you quickly busy yourself preparing for the day's assignment. You all stand around your assignment board staring at a small piece of parchment that simply says "Market District". You all make your last minute preparations, and then start to make your way to the Market District when you see both Captain Geberic and Lieutenant Vandil looking concerned speaking with a fellow guard who is slightly out of breath. Lieutenant Vandil notices you and and moves to intercept you._

_"Hold on please, I know I've assigned you to patrol the Market District today but I've a new assignment for you. Something just came up, follow me". He motions for your to follow and he walks back to Captain Geberic and the winded Guard. Geberic looks at you all as you approach, he greets you curtly: "Good, standby. We've got a situation here. Got another Unit coming too, once Kade here catches his breath he'll brief you all on what he knows and then you can be about it."_

_You wait for a minute or two in heavy silence as Kade's breathing slowly becomes normal, while Geberic stands with his arms crossed, eyes unfocused, stroking his mustache while thinking quietly to himself. Vandil stands at his side, keeping his silence for now. Footsteps are heard and 3 more familiar Guards arrive on the scene: The same 3 guards that you relieved from the Main Gate. Upon seeing you they flash a quick smile your way, the raven-haired woman giving a friendly greeting: "Well hello again, what trouble are we into today?"_

_Upon their arrival Geberic gives them a similar curt greeting that you received: "Good, we're all here. Kade, tell us what happened, what do we know?". Kade takes another deep breath and then speaks:_ 

_"Yes sir, me and my mates were assigned to the Main Gate, when a wounded merchant came galloping in, even his horse was wounded, almost didn't stop. Once we calmed the beast down we were able to help the man off the horse and before we could even start looking to his wounds he started yelling that he was attacked. Well we all pulled inside the gate quickly, Wilkes shut the gate, just in case they was chasing him. Brenn calmed the man down and started asking for specifics. We weren't able to get much out of his before he passed out, but I'll relay what we found out._ 

_Their Caravan had about 3 wagons total, each drawn by 2 horses each. They were taken by surprise. Brenn asked the man if they had hired anyone to protect the caravan from attacks, and the man said he hired a few mercanaries but he didn't know what happened to them. Said one moment they were plodding along the main road, and the next there was screaming, and the horses panicked and started trying to run off, which lead to his wagon flipping over. Said he managed to cut off the harness from one of the horses and jump onto his back and ride back here. Brenn asked him where exactly this happened, and he said it was near the edge of the forest, which is just a few hours travel from here. Lieutenant Connor woke up from all the noise and told me to run back here and tell Captain Geberic. That's what we know right now, we're not sure how many attacked them, or even_ what _attacked them."_

_Geberic turns to everyone: "That's the situation, I'm assigning your two squads to investigate what happened. If you find who was behind this attack and it's within your means to deal with them, do so. If you find yourself outnumbered, don't risk it, send a rider back to me immediately with a detailed report, and I'll make sure you get reinforcements."_

_He turns to the other squad: "Erika, Euric, Gundiok, I know you three have senority and normally I'd put you lot in charge, but this time I'm going to put them in charge." He look over at you: "They haven't been here long and already they've proven extremely capable." He addresses everyone: "Get yourselves ready for a hurried march. If you're lacking weaponry, go see Quartermaster Berig and he'll issue you additional arms and rations should you need it. You leave immediately. Dismissed." He motions for you all to go about your business. As you leave you can hear him giving orders to Kade telling him to reopen the gate but be on alert._

_As you all head back to your quarters to prepare, the other squad approches, the raven-haired woman speaks: "Sounds like you lot call the shots, we never got the introduce ourselves when you relieved us from the Main Gate yesterday. This is Euric, he don't talk much around strangers so we usually make him play "bad guard", but he's a good one." Euric is a rugged man, thin wispy hair with kind, but hard eyes. He has a few scars on his face, and it looks like his nose was broken and never set properly. He smiles and gives a friendly wave._

_She gestures to the larger man, barrel chested, hairy, and rather than a sword he carried a warhammer. "This big brute is Gundiok, but you can call him Gundy, despite his looks he's a gentle soul. Well, he's gentle when he's not swinging that gigantic headache-on-a-stick that is." Gundiok's lips crack back to reveal a smile of broken teeth._

_She turns from "Gundy" and then continues: "And then that leaves me. I'm Erika, they usually let me do the talking since most folks seem to be more willing to talk to me, but don't think that just because I'm a woman that I can't hold my own in a fight." Despite her pleasant demeanor, your can see she is also sporting a few scars herself. "Anyway we introduced ourselves, who are you?"_

Give the players a chance to introduce themselves (if they wish)

_"Must be kind of a big deal to make Geberic decide to put you in charge over us. Don't worry though, we don't mind following, just don't get us killed ok? We need to look out for all of us, and we need to find out who or what was behind this attack. We'll get kitted out and meet you back here when you're ready to set out. We need to hurry!". With that she turns and follows Euric and Gundiok back to their quarters to prepare, and you should do the same._

At this point the players can do whatever they wish to prepare. If they wish to see Quartermaster Berig for additional supplies, he can issue them Helmets (1 armor), Shields (1 armor), Swords (1d8), and Bows (1d6, bulky) should they wish it, as well as 3 days of rations (1 slot)

Once everything is ready, they can set out. Travel is fairly straightforward:
 - Should only take a few hours to get to the scene of the attack
 - Time will be about mid-afternoon
 - Weather will be overcast

Once they arrive on scene, read the following aloud:

_You see the edge of the forest becoming clearer, everyone keenly scanning for signs of any threat. Behind you, you hear a snapping sound, and turn to see Gundiok gingerly lifting his boot off of whatever he just stepped on. Erika rushes over and picks it up. She holds up a broken crossbow bolt._

_"Gundy just stepped on this, it was jutting out of the ground in the middle of the road, like it was fired from that direction." she points up ahead. "Wonder if they were trying to kill the merchant who ran. Either way it looks like we're in range of attack now, so be ready." Her tone softens a bit as she sheepishly says "Sorry, used to only working with Euric and Gundy here, you're in charge, so what's the plan?"_ 

From here the players can decide how best to move forward. Here are the key details of what they'll find up ahead:
 - The 3 wagons are still there, many crossbow bolts are sticking out of the sides of them.
 - The only corpses that are there are but a few horses that appeared to have caught a few stray bolts.
 - All of the cargo in the wagons appears to still remain there, untouched.
 - Among the untouched cargo, is another Cryptic Letter (the words make no sense, some type of code, unreadable)
 - Wide trails can be found in the forest, as if a large number of people moved as a group through it.

Once the players have gathered as much info as they can and had a chance to discuss it amongst themselves, read the following aloud:

_You all regroup to share your findings. Euric speaks up, taking a break from furiously scribbling notes he was taking: "It's wrong. None of this makes sense." Gundiok grunts in agreement, his eyes surveilling the surroundings for any further danger. Erika also speaks up "All the wagons are here, all the goods are untouched, there's not a single corpse, I wasn't even able to determine if there was a struggle at all. And why crossbows? Judging by how many bolts were fired, and by all that crushed undergroth beyond the tree line... I'd say there were at least 20 of them. But where are the other merchants? Where are the mercanaries they hired to protect them? What do these Cryptic Letters mean? We've been finding them all over lately. This all feels off."_

_As Erika trails off, Euric speaks again: "We're also faced with a tough decision. There's only a few of us. We're outnumbered, but we're sorely lacking in information. Geberic said to send word back for reinforcements if it was beyond us, but at this point we don't know enough. We know we're up against at least 20 or so crossbows, but who wields them? Why attack this caravan and not take any of the loot? Why weren't we able to find bodies, or even any signs of a real struggle? This resembles casual target practice rather than combat, and a few poor horses suffered the most, but the others must've ran off. We need to know more." Erika nods in agreement, she chimes in: "I agree with Euric, we need to know more, but I'm hesitant to follow the trail knowing we're outnumbered."_

_Your thoughts are suddenly interrupted, you feel the ground shake slightly, and hear a thud in the forest. You all look to one another to see if you experienced it to, then another thud. Suddenly an angry Forest Troll emerges from the forest, roaring and running right at you! Erika shouts: "Everyone spread out, try to keep distance and we'll bring this brute down!"

### Attacked Caravan: Conclusion
Give the players a chance to rest and recover their HP, Erika's team can help heal any critical damage if they're still alive. Then read the following aloud:

_Gundiok suddenly speaks in an urgent gruff tone: "Something is wrong". He points his meaty hairy arm back in the direction of Eimgan: "Look!" Thick black clouds of smoke are beginning to rise up over Eimgan. Erika, Euric, and Gundiok exchange worried glances with eachother and all of you. Erika says in a shaking voice: "What is happening?" She looks to you all: "We have to get back to the city!"_

## 10: The Attack on Eimgan
TODO: Here's what I'm thinking:
 - The people have risen up and killed Marcomir
 - Geberic tried to stop it from happening, and the populace turned on the Guard
 - Widespread riots are rampant, Geberic is holding the Barracks protecting what innocents he can with what few guards he has left

When the players arrive, it's chaos in the streets.
 - There will be innocents fleeing the chaos
 - Occasional rioters will attack the players on their way to the barracks
 - Once they reach the barracks they'll get updated on the situation by Geberic
 - Geberic is melancholy, thinks they failed in their oaths
 - Many guards have died, there's not many left
 - The barracks is packed with innocent refugees seeking protection from the chaos
 - One among them is a traitor
 - The plan is to break out and get the refugees outside the city, and seek refuge in Clurgh or Ontstead
